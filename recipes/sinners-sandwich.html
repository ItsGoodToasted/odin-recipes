<p>Anyone who's played Deadly Premonition should remember this strange
    yet oddly tasty sandwich that detective York Morgan once tried.
</p>
<p>Below you will find the how to guide for recreating it.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<list>
    <li>A loaf of White Crustless Bread</li>
    <li>2 Turkey Breasts</li>
    <li>A Jar of High Quality Strawberry Jam or Conserve</li>
    <li>Cereal, preferably grain based</li>
    <li>Butter or Margerine</li>
</list>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Cook breasts</li>
    <p>I bought my turkey breast fresh and cooked it slowly in the 
        oven with a little butter - but feel free to use pre-cooked 
        chunks, not processed slices.</p>

    <li>Assembled bread</li>
    <p>Get two pieces of bread; spread a little butter on one and the 
        strawberry conserve liberally on the other.</p>

    <li>Cut Breasts</li>
    <p>Cut the turkey breast into medium slices at an angle and lay the 
        pieces onto the buttered piece of bread.</p>

    <li>Sprinkle Cereal</li>
    <p>Pick a cereal of your choice and sprinkle generously over the conserve.</p>

    <li>Assembled sandwich</li>
    <p>Place the second piece of bread strawberry side down on top and 
        cut the sandwich diagonally to serve.</p>
